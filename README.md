[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/airportyh/testem.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/airportyh/testem)

Javascript unit testing can be tedious and painful. Testem aims to make Javascript unit testing in browsers as easy as it possibly can be - so that you will no longer have *any* excuse for not writing tests. Testem supports [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/), [QUnit](http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit) and [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) right out of the box, and can be made to work with others via custom test framework adapters. It supports two distinct use-cases: the *test-driven-development(TDD)* workflow; and *continuous integration(CI)*. 

Screencast
----------

Watch this [screencast](http://youtu.be/ZyUN__C3xgY) to see it in action. 

Requirements
------------

You need [Node](http://nodejs.org/) version 0.6.2 or later installed on your system.

Installation
------------
To install:

    npm install testem -g
    
This will install the `testem` executable globally on your system.

Usage
-----

As stated before, Testem supports two use cases: test-driven-development and continuous integration. Let's go over each one.

### Development Mode

The simplest way to use Testem, in the TDD spirit, is to start in an empty directory and run the command

    testem
    
You will see a terminal-based interface which looks like this
    
![Initial interface](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/raw/master/images/initial.png)
    
Now open your browser and go to the specified URL. You should now see

![Zero of zero](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/raw/master/images/zeros.png)
    
We see 0/0 for tests because at this point we haven't written any code, but as we write them, Testem will pickup any `.js` files
 that were added, include them, and if there are tests, run them automatically. So let's first write `hello_spec.js` in the spirit of "test first"(written in Jasmine)

    describe('hello', function(){
        it('should say hello', function(){
            expect(hello()).toBe('hello world')
        })
    })
    
Save that file and now you should see

![Red](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/raw/master/images/red.png)

Testem should automatically pickup the new files you've added and also any changes that you make to them, and rerun the tests. The test fails as we'd expect. Now we implement the spec like so in `hello.js`

    function hello(){
        return "hello world"
    }

So you should now see

#### Using the Text User Interface

In development mode, Testem has a text-based graphical user interface which uses keyboard-based controls. Here is a list of the control keys

* ENTER : Run the tests
* q : Quit
* ← LEFT ARROW  : Move to the next browser tab on the left
* → RIGHT ARROW : Move to the next browser tab on the right
* ↑ UP ARROW : scroll up in the error window
* ↓ DOWN ARROW : scroll down in the error window

#### Command line options

To see all command line options do

    testem --help

#### DIY: Use Any Test Framework

If you want to use Testem with a test framework that's not supported out of the box, you can write your own custom test framework adapter. See [customAdapter.js](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/blob/master/examples/custom_adapter/customAdapter.js) for an example of how to write a custom adapter.

Then, to use it, in your `testem.yml` simply set

    framework: custom

And then make sure you include the adapter code in your test suite and you are ready to go. Here for the [full example](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/tree/master/examples/custom_adapter).

#### Example Projects

I've created [examples](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/tree/master/examples/) for various setups

* [Simple QUnit project](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/tree/master/examples/qunit_simple)
* [Simple Jasmine project](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/tree/master/examples/jasmine_simple)
* [Custom Jasmine project](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/tree/master/examples/jasmine_custom)
* [Custom Jasmine project using Require.js](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/tree/master/examples/jasmine_requirejs)
* [Simple Mocha Project](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/tree/master/examples/mocha_simple)
* [Custom Test Framework](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/tree/master/examples/custom_adapter)

### Continuous Integration Mode

To use Testem for continuous integration you'd do

    testem ci
    
In CI mode, Testem runs your tests on all the browsers that are available on the system one after another. To find out what browsers are currently available - those that Testem knows about and can make use of

    testem ci -l
    
Will print them out. The output might look like

    $ testem ci -l
    Browsers available on this system: 
    IE7
    IE8
    IE9
    Chrome
    Firefox
    Safari
    Opera
    PhantomJS
    
Did you notice that this system has IE versions 7-9? Yes, actually it has only IE9 installed, but Testem uses IE's compatibility mode feature to emulate IE 7 and 8.

When you run `testem ci` to run tests, it outputs the results in the [TAP](http://testanything.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) format, which looks like

    ok 1 Chrome 16.0 - hello should say hello.

    1..1
    # tests 1
    # pass  1

    # ok
    
TAP is a human-readable and language-agnostic test result format. TAP plugins exist for popular CI servers

* [Jenkins TAP plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin) - I've added [detailed instructions](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/blob/master/docs/use_with_jenkins.md) for setup with Jenkins.
* [TeamCity TAP plugin](https://github.com/pavelsher/teamcity-tap-parser)

#### Selecting Specific Browsers

To select a specific browser or set of browsers, use the `-b` option:

    testem ci -b IE9
    testem ci -b Firefox,Chrome

To skip a specific browser or set of browsers, use the `-s` option:

    testem ci -s IE7  # don't run on IE7

#### Command line options

To see all command line options for CI, do

    testem ci --help
    
Configuration File
------------------

For the simplest Javascript projects, the TDD workflow described above will work fine, but there are times when you want
to structure your sources files into separate directories, or want to have finer control over what files to include, this calls for the `testem.yml` configuration file. It looks like this

    framework: jasmine
    src_files:
    - hello.js
    - hello_spec.js

The src_files can also be glob patterns (See: [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob))

    src_files:
    - js/**/*.js
    - spec/**/*.js

Custom Test Pages
-----------------

You can also use a custom page for testing. To do this, first you need to specify `test_page` to point to your test page in the config file(`framework` and `src_files` are irrelevant in this case)

    test_page: tests.html
    
Next, the test page you use needs to have the adapter code installed on them, as specified in the next section.

### Include Snippet

Include this snippet directly after your `jasmine.js`, `qunit.js` or `mocha.js` include to enable *Testem* with your test page

    <script>
    if (location.hash === '#testem')
        document.write('<script src="/testem.js"></'+'script>')
    </script>

Go Completely Headless with PhantomJS
-------------------------------------

If you have [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/) installed in your system and the `phantomjs` executable is in your path. In development mode, Testem will use it automatically to run your tests for your convenience. For CI, PhantomJS will be one of the available browsers and will be made use of by default.

Contributing
------------

If you want to [contribute to the project](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/blob/master/docs/contributing.md), I am going to do my best to stay out of your way. 

Roadmap
-------

1. Getting feedback from other folks using Testem in the real world, and then improve the user experience as much as possible.
2. [BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com/user/dashboard) integration - after seeing [Bunyip](http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/bunyip) I was like oh snap! I need to get on this. 
3. Travis CI integration.
3. Buster.JS integration.
3. Figure out a happy path for testing on mobile browsers (maybe BrowserStack).
4. Direct Coffeescript support.
